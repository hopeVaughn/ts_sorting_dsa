## We will be working within node in project and not the browser. 
- Create a directory in the root of your project called 'src'
- inside the the /src directory create a file named 'index.ts'
- In the root of the project create a folder named 'build'
### We will create a configuration file to read the typeScript input from the src directory and compile and output our code to an index.js file located inside our build folder. To create a TypeScript config file you'll need to be in the root directory of your project inside your terminal window.
- Enter in ``` tsc ---init ``` and press enter
- This will generate a tsconfig.json file in the root of your project directory
