  "description": "- Create a directory in the root of your project called 'src' - inside the the /src directory create a file named 'index.ts' - In the root of the project create a folder named 'build' ### We will create a configuration file to read the typeScript input from the src directory and compile and output our code to an index.js file located inside our build folder. To create a TypeScript config file you'll need to be in the root directory of your project inside your terminal window. - Enter in ``` tsc ---init ``` and press enter - This will generate a tsconfig.json file in the root of your project directory #### Open the tsconfig.json file in your editor - Use the find function while in the file to locate the outDir and rootDir keys.  - Update the rootDir value to ` './src' ` - Update the outDir value to ` './build' ` - Confirm this worked by adding a ```javascript console.log('Hello TypeScript')``` to your index.ts file in the ./src directory - In your terminal run the command `tsc` and confirm that index.js is now present in your ./build directory ##### Once confirmed note that we will be using the command `tsc -w` moving forward. This command allows the compiler to watch for any changes that may happen to the index.ts file in the root directory and apply changes as they happen. - Open a second terminal window in the same directory and run the command `node build/index.js",
